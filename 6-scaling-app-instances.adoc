### Scale up and Scale down and Idle the application instances

:data-uri:

In this exercise we will learn how to scale our application. OpenShift
has the capability to scale your application and make sure that many
instances are always running.

*Step 1: Switch to an existing project*

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userXX* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

For this exercise, we will be using an already running application. We
will be using the `mycliproject-userXX` that you created in the
previous labs. Make sure you are switched to that project by using the
`oc project` command.

----
$ oc project mycliproject-userXX
----

*Step 2: View the deployment config*

Take a look at the `deploymentConfig` (or `dc`) of the `time`
application:

----
$ oc get dc/myhttpdapp -o yaml

  replicas: 1
  unavailableReplicas: 0
  updatedReplicas: 1
----

Note that the `replicas:` is set to `1`. This tells OpenShift that when
this application deploys, make sure that there is 1 instance.

The `replicationController` mirrors this configuration initially; the
`replicationController` (or `rc`) will ensure that there is always the
set number of instances always running.

To view the `rc` for your application first get the current pod running.

----
$ oc get pods

NAME                 READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
myhttpdapp-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          21h
myhttpdapp-1-cc4s2   1/1       Running     0          21h
----

This shows that the build `myhttpdapp-1` is running in pod `cc4s2`. Let us
view the `rc` on this build.

----
$  oc get rc/myhttpdapp-1

NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
myhttpdapp-1   1         1         1         21h

----

NOTE: You can change the number of replicas in `DeploymentConfig` or
the `ReplicationController`.

However note that if you change the `deploymentConfig` it applies to
your application. This means, even if you delete the current replication
controller, the new one that gets created will be assigned the REPLICAS
value based on what is set for DC. If you change it on the Replication
Controller, the application will scale up. But if you happen to delete
the current replication controller for some reason, you will loose that
setting.

*Step 3: Scale Application*

To scale your application we will edit the `deploymentConfig` to 3.

Open your browser to the Overview page and note you only have one
instance running.

image::scale_updown_overview.png[image]

Now scale your application using the `oc scale` command (remembering to
specify the `dc`)

----
$ oc scale --replicas=3 dc/myhttpdapp

deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/myhttpdapp scaled

----

If you look at the web console and you will see that there are 3
instances running now

image::scale_updown_overview_scaled.png[image]

*Note:* You can also scale up and down from the web console by going to
the project overview page and clicking twice on
image:scale_up.jpg[width="10%"] right next to the pod count circle to
add 2 more pods.

On the command line, see how many pods you are running now:

----
$ oc get pods

NAME                 READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
myhttpdapp-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          21h
myhttpdapp-1-cc4s2   1/1       Running     0          21h
myhttpdapp-1-csl7f   1/1       Running     0          1m
myhttpdapp-1-f7mp7   1/1       Running     0          1m

----

You now have 3 instances of `time-1` running (each with a different
pod-id). If you check the `rc` of the `time-1` build you will see that
it has been updated by the `dc`.

----
$ oc get rc/myhttpdapp-1

NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
myhttpdapp-1   3         3         3         21h

----

*Step 4: Idling the application*

Run the following command to find the available endpoints

----
$ oc get endpoints

NAME         ENDPOINTS                                        AGE
myhttpdapp   10.1.4.123:8080,10.1.4.124:8080,10.1.4.60:8080   21h

----

Note that the name of the endpoints is `myhttpdapp` and there are three ips
addresses for the three pods.

Run the `oc idle endpoints/myhttpdapp` command to idle the application

----
$ oc idle endpoints/myhttpdapp

The service "mycliproject-user1/myhttpdapp" has been marked as idled
The service will unidle DeploymentConfig "mycliproject-user1/myhttpdapp" to 3 replicas once it receives traffic
DeploymentConfig "mycliproject-user1/myhttpdapp" has been idled

----

Go back to the webconsole. You will notice that the pods show up as
idled.

image::idled_pods.png[Idle Pods,300,align="center"]

At this point the application is idled, the pods are not running and no
resources are being used by the application. This doesn't mean that the
application is deleted. The current state is just saved that's all.

*Step 6: Reactivate your application*

Now click on the application route URL or access the application via curl.

Note that it takes a little while for the application to respond. This
is because pods are spinning up again. You can notice that in the web
console.

In a little while the output comes up and your application would be up
with 3 pods.

So, as soon as the user accesses the application, it comes up!!!

*Step 7: Scaling Down*

Scaling down is the same procedure as scaling up. Use the `oc scale`
command on the `myhttpdapp` application `dc` setting.

----
$ oc scale --replicas=1 dc/myhttpdapp

deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/myhttpdapp scaled

----

Alternately, you can go to project overview page and click on
image:scale_down.jpg[width="10%"] twice to remove 2 running pods.

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about scaling and
how to scale up/down your application on OpenShift!
